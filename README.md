Seminar: GEO 419A - Modulare Programmierung in der Fernerkundung


## Description

This code was developed as a final project of a university course on modular programming in remote sensing. The aim is to implement the downloading and unpacking of a zip file as well as the processing and visualization of a geotiff file.

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

## Installation

In addition to the code we provide a yml-file that can be used to create a conda environment. In order to do this ypu have to run the following code in your terminal or an Anaconda Prompt.

    ```
    conda env create -f GEO419Aenv.yml
    ```

To install What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
